## DESCRIPTION OF BUG

The issue here lies in the fact that `UnstoppableVault.sol::flashloan` requires that `uint256 balanceBefore` which is `UnstoppableVault.sol::totalAssets()` to be equal to `convertToShares(totalSupply)`. So in the possibility that this is manipulated, for example, if a user sends in extra tokens to the flashloan contract, that requirement will be broken and it will result to a DOS as no one will be able to enter the contract. Check the `TestUnstoppableVault.sol` for POC.
